# Introduction: 

### What is a Web Crawler?
Web crawling is a technique that refers to visiting pages and discovering URLs on a site. It enables the collection of large amounts of data from many pages.

### What is Web Scraping? 
the process of retrieving data from the web. Even copying and pasting content from a page is a form of scraping! But it usually refers to the task performed by an automated software (script, bot, crawler, spider etc...) that visits a website and extracts the data of interest from its pages

### Is there a difference between Web Crawling and Web Scraping?
web scraping is about extracting data from one or more websites. While crawling is about finding or discovering URLs or links on the web

### Why Python? Can we use another language?    
Python is easy-to-use with a large community and a vast library bank. Python has become the most popular language for AI/ML and web scraping puropose. We can also use other languages (It will be a future project)

# Steps: 

### Steps involved in Scraping Process: -
1. **Inspect the target site:**
            - Get an idea of what information is to be extracted from the site. 
            - Study about the HTML elements position on the pages.
            - Study about the data to be extracted 
2. **Get the page's HTML code:** 
            - Access the HTML content by downloading the page's documents. To accomplish that:
            - Use an HTTP client library, like Requests, to connect to your target website.
            - HTTP GET requests to the server with the URLs of the pages to scrape.
            - Verify that the server returned the HTML document successfully.
3. **Extract your data from the HTML document:**  Obtain the information you're after, usually a specific piece of data or a list of items. To achieve this:
            - Parse the HTML content with a data parsing library, like Beautiful Soup.
            - Select the HTML content of interest with the same library.
            - Write the scraping logic to extract information from these elements. 
            - If the website consists of many pages and you want to scrape them all:
            - Extract the links to follow from the current page and add them to a queue.
            - Follow the first link and go back until the queue is empty.
4. **Store the extracted data:** Once extracted, transform and store it in a format that makes it easier to use. To reach this:
            - Convert the scraped content to CSV, JSON, or similar formats and export them to a file.
            - Write it to a database.

# Scraping Use Cases
- **Competitor Analysis:** Gather data from your competitors' sites about their products/services, features, and marketing approaches, to monitor them and gain a competitive edge.

- **Price Comparison:** Collect prices from several e-commerce platforms to compare them and find the best deals.

- **Lead Generation:** Extract contact information from websites, such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers, to create targeted marketing lists for businesses. But be aware of your national laws when personal information is involved.

- **Sentiment Analysis:** Retrieve news and posts from social media to track public opinion about a topic or a brand.

- **Social Media Analytics:** Recover data from social platforms, such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and Reddit, to track the popularity and engagement of specific hashtags, keywords, or influencers.

- **Competitive Pricing Analysis:** Our web scraping tool can be used to gather pricing data from competitor websites, allowing businesses to compare prices and adjust their own pricing strategies accordingly. By regularly scraping competitor sites, businesses can stay competitive in the market and attract more customers with competitive pricing.

- **Social Media Monitoring:** Our tool enables users to scrape data from various social media platforms to monitor public sentiment, track trends, and analyze user engagement. For example, businesses can track mentions of their brand or products on social media to gauge customer satisfaction and identify areas for improvement in their marketing strategies.

# Challenges in Web Scraping: 

- **Variety:** The diversity in website layouts, styles, and data structures necessitates custom-built scraping scripts for each target.
  
- **Longevity:** Web pages frequently change their structure and content, causing scraping scripts to stop working and requiring adaptation.
  
- **Scalability:** Increasing data volume raises concerns about spider performance. Solutions like distributed systems, parallel scraping, and code optimization can enhance scalability.

- **Anti-bot technologies**: These are the measures that sites take to protect against malicious or unwanted bots and include scrapers by default. pose obstacles to scraping efforts: 
- **IP Blocking:** Websites may block IP addresses used by scrapers.
- **JavaScript Challenges:** Sites may employ JavaScript-based challenges to deter scrapers.  
- **CAPTCHAs:** CAPTCHAs hinder automated scraping by requiring human interaction.

Future Idea: To overcome these challenges, techniques such as rotating proxies and headless browsers can be employed, or services like ZenRows can simplify the process.

# Web Scraping Process

## Setting up the Environment

- **Python** : I have installed Python 3.12.2
